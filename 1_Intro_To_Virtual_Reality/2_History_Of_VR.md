# History of VR

There are many advances that can be considered the beginning of virtual reality. You could look at the origins of computer graphics, or the philosophical concept of alternate realities. You could draw a line from the many advancements in film and animation, or you could say it all started with the invention of the computer. For us, the history of VR begins with 3D display technology. That was the first line of invention that led directly to what we call VR today.

The beginning of 3D display technology starts with the stereoscope in 1838. One picture was shown to the left eye and another picture is shown to the right. The two pictures are of the same object. There are a pair of mirrors at 45 degree angles to the user's eyes and each is reflecting a picture off to the side. When the two views of the same object are shown to their respective eye in the same location, they fuse to form a view of a solid 3D object.

After the stereoscope, there were a number of improvements on 3D displays. The next biggest VR advancement was the Sword of Damocles from MIT 1968. It was the first device to track a users head motion and overlay synthetic 3D stereoscopic computer generated graphics into their vision. The device had a long mechanical arm that extended from the ceiling and attached to the users head. The user was shown primitive, wireframe 3D objects projected onto a transparent display. In this way, the Sword of Damocles was the first augmented reality display as well.

Later in the early 1990s, we saw virtual reality first promoted to the general public thanks to advancements made by NASA and VPL. Consumer VR seemed like it was a possibility. However, the devices that sold during this time period did not live up to the high expectations of VR. Then the devices lost their popularity until 2012.

In 2012 a kick-starter for a new inexpensive VR device called the Oculus Rift brought VR back. The booming mobile phone industry had driven down the price of high quality display technology, and Oculus leveraged this fact and used a clever single-paneled display system to manufacture an inexpensive, high-quality VR headset. Then it was bought by FaceBook for $2 billion.

Now we are experiencing a second wave of consumer VR, and this time it is here for good.
